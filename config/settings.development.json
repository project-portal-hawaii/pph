Eliminating confusion in\nscheduling since they currently use a variety of ways to track\ntheir maintenance from paper to excel which heavily rely on\nworkers to track. Features:\n● Simplified Design\n○ Our sponsor wanted a software that was visually easy to\nuse where you could just click and add a PMI event\n● Scheduler listed time\n○ With this feature you can adjust how you see the\nscheduler based on your time frame(day, month,\nquarter, year)\n● Adjustability of PMI Events\n○ Adjustability was an important feature as our sponsor\nwanted the ability to drag and move PMI events as the\ntotal days increase\n● Change Phase Lane Names\n○ This feature gives the user the ability to change how\neach phase lane is titled\n● Add Phase Lanes\n○ Phase lanes are no longer stagnant and can be added to\nthe bottom of the scheduler\n● Displays Basic PMI Information\n○ Hovering over the PMI events will show basic\ninformation needed to keep track of the PMI Schedules\n● Begin Non-Working Days Page\n○ As seen in the navbar we have begun work on a page\nwhere a user could input new holidays or other non-\nworking days which would in the future connect to be\nseen on the main scheduler page",
